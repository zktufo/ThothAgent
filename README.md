# ThothAgent

> A self-improving framework for domain-specific AI agents with layered memory, adaptive retrieval, and session-aware orchestration.

ThothAgent is a configurable runtime for building vertical AI copilots that improve over time through persistent memory, provider-based retrieval, tool feedback loops, and structured session lifecycle management.

## Why ThothAgent

- Build domain-specific agents instead of one-off chatbots
- Persist long-term memory across sessions with layered memory architecture
- Route memory through pluggable external providers instead of hard-coded storage
- Keep session continuity with SQLite-backed history, summaries, and compaction
- Combine tools, retrieval, and memory into a single agent runtime
- Evolve agent behavior over time through explicit memory writes and conversation insights

## Core Capabilities

- Layered memory: `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`, `DOMAIN.md`, working state, and external retrieval
- Adaptive retrieval: provider-driven `memory_search` with hybrid lexical/embedding scoring
- Session orchestration: active session routing, indexing, archival summaries, and compaction
- Tool runtime: native tool catalog, secure execution harness, and structured trace logging
- Pluggable providers: local file provider by default, extensible for remote memory backends
- Multi-surface control: CLI, TUI, gateway, and web control UI

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zktufo/ThothAgent.git
cd ThothAgent
npm install
npm run build
node dist/cli/main.js tui
```

## External Memory Providers

ThothAgent treats external memory as a provider capability rather than a fixed local database.

- Default provider: `local-file`
- Config path: `memory.externalProvider` in `~/.PetAgent/PetAgent.json`
- Search path: `memory_search` calls the currently configured provider abstraction
- Future-ready: remote providers such as Honcho can be added without rewriting the tool layer

## Self-Improvement Loop

ThothAgent is designed to improve over time through a simple but extensible loop:

1. The agent completes a turn
2. High-value turns trigger background memory persistence
3. Explicit `memory` writes are stored as durable retrieval records
4. Session summaries and conversation insights become searchable long-term memory
5. Later turns can recall and reuse those insights through provider-backed retrieval

## Web Control UI

The built-in web UI provides:

- chat surface with live session sync
- dashboard view for runtime state
- Apple-inspired glass UI system
- multimodal input entrypoints
- animated message timeline and trace visibility

## Development

```bash
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm run memory:test
```
